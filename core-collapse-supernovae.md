* Some interesting notes:
    * Type II releases $\approx 10^46$ J, w/ about 1% of this energy as kinetic energy of the ejected material, 0.01% released as photons -- the remainder is neutrinos!
* Types Ib, Ic, II = CCSNe!
* **Mechanism of Core-Collapse Supernovae**
    * Very high temp. core in stars with mass > 8 $M_\odot$ means C, O can burn
    * He burning shell continues to add "ash" to C-O core, and this core continues to contract --> eventually, it begins burning carbon, producing byproducts incl. \ce{^{16}_{8}O}, \ce{^{20}_{10}Ne}, etc.
    * ***Onion-like*** shell develops as each reaction sequence reaches equilibrium
    * After carbon burning, Ne-O ignites, producing a new core dominated by \ce{^{28}_{14}Si}
    * This silicon begins burning at $T ~ 3 \times 10^9$ K (reactions coming soon if I think they are nessecary)
    * Silicon burning produces nuclei centered near \ce{^{56}_{26}Fe} of the binding energy per nucleon curve shown below, most of which are \ce{^{54}_{26}Fe}, \ce{^{56}_{26}Fe}, \ce{^{56}_{28}Ni} --> typically, these are grouped together as forming an ***iron core***.
        * (Diagram coming soon, Fig 10.9)
        * Side note: While, H, He burning last $10^7$ and $10^6$ years, C takes 300 years, O 200 days, and Si 2 days
    * At the very high temperatures in this core, **photodisintegration** begins
        * eqns. coming soon; Fe broken into He and n, He broken into p+ and n
        * highly endothermic! removing energy from surrounding gases that would support the star!
    * Under these extreme conditions, e- (which had supported star through degeneracy pressure) are no captured by heavy nuclei and protons produced through photodisintegration!
        * \ce{p+ + e- -> n + v_e}
    * With electron capture + photodisintegration, support for the core is suddenly gone!
        * Rapidly collapses; in the inner portion, the collapse is homologous (uniform?), such that the ***velocity of th ecollapse is proportional to the distance away from the center of the star**) --> see [homologous free-fall collapse during protostar formation](star-formation)
        * At some radius, the velocity exceeds the local sound speed-- then, the collapse is no longer homologous, and the inner core decouples from the now-supersonic outercore --> i.e., the outer-core is now left in "free-fall", left behind by the inner core; even though both are supersonic, the inner core is much faster from the relationship of velocity and distnace
            * What is this relationship exactly? Will the core always become supersonic/experience this kind of decoupling?
    * When the density of the inner core reaches $8 \times 10^{17} kg m^{-3}$ (~3 times the density of the atomic nucleus!) the nuclear material that now makes up the inner core stiffens -- this is because of the Pauli exlcusion principle applied to neutrons, which causes the typically-attractive strong nuclear force to become repulsive
        * inner core now rebounds, sending pressure waves into infalling material from outer-core... and when they reach the sound speed, they build into a shcok waves that begins to move outward
            * So-- it sounds like the core is kind of rebounding over a time-domain, continually sending these rebound-resultant pressure waves into the infalling material, until they reach the sonud speed?
                * I guess other dynamics, like convection/composition would also affect the sound speed.
                * Actually--good question-- how significant **are** these other effects?
        * this causes further photodisintegration in the outer core material, which robs a **lot** of energy from the shock
    * Eventually, the shock "stalls" (almost stationary), becomes **accretion shock** w/ infalling material accreeting on to it; see [protostellar-collapse](star-formation)
        * Below this shock, a **neutrinosphere** develops!

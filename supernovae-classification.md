* **Type I** - do not exhibit any hydrogen lines in their spectra (odd, because H is the most abundant element).
    * **Type Ia** - strong Si II line at 615 nm.
    * **Type Ib** - have strong He lines.
    * **Type Ic** - do not have strong He lines.
    * Type Ib and Ic are found specifically in the [H II regions](star-forming-regions) (star forming regions) of spiral galaxies, while Type Ia are found in all galaxies, including elliptical galaxies w/ little star formation... indicates that Ib and Ic are the result of short-lived, massive stars, while Ia are not
        * Aren't Ia the result of matter being dumped onto a white dwarf, usually in a binary system, pushing it over the Chandrasekhar limit?

* **Type II**
    * characterized optically by a rapid rise in luminosity, reaching a max. brightness which is 1.5 mag. *dimmer* than Type Ia, followed by steady decrease.
    * **light curve categorization**
        * **Type II-L** (linear) - after initial decrease in luminosity, hits a point (~80 - 100 days) at which it has continuous linear decrease in luminosity.
        * **Type II-P** (plateau) - after initial decrease in luminosity (near peak), hits a plateau from ~30 days - 80 days, before decreasing
            * occurs 10x more often than Type II-L!
                * Is this a consequence of observational techniques/position/etc.? Or something else?
